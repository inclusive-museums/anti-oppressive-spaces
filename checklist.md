# Checklist

Some things worth thinking about at the start of your museum's next project:

- Are your signup forms respectful of people outside the gender binary?
- Do icons, photos, etc. assume things about gender or race of users?
- Is the project accessible for people with sensory impairments?
- Does the writing (especially in curatorial content) use language that visitors might find alienating/off-putting?
- What data are you collecting? Do you really need to be collecting it? Does the project respect the privacy of users (ex: online visitors in another country looking at content that might be considered restricted in their country of origin - gay rights, political content, etc).
- Who’s not here? Why?


# Practices

- Collect all our user data in changeable, free-form text fields
- Establish guidelines for discourse on-line (See contributor-covenant.org, blog.discourse.org/2013/03/the-universal-rules-of-civilized-discourse/, and hypatiasoftware.org/code-of-conduct/)
- Be clear on why we're collecting each piece of data and what we’re doing with it
- Non-gendered, non-raced user icons
- Don't stage false diverse photographs
- Using analytics: Decide, act, measure vs. measure, decide, act
- Have face-to-face conversations with your colleagues
- Implement Universal Design and Learning

# Exercises

- Critique your organization’s inclusion work based on: what they do, what they think they do, and what they won't do
- Take 5 minutes at the beginning of a design phase to consider how to make something anti-oppressive. Use the Checklist!

# Broader ideas
- Create relationships and co-create with people of color
- Share institutional power
- POC are going to create content more interesting to POC
- GET OUT of the museum
- Join orgs that are advocating for social justice issues or movement
- Create work based on the needs of people
- “Design for your community, not for the world”
- Invest time in communities that are being affected by the presence of museum, of histories hidden in the archive, or not told in exhibitions
- Identify reusable wins
- Find out how to connect your work with movements
- Use money to subsidize programming
- Leadership must make inclusion a priority and lens through which all work is approached.
