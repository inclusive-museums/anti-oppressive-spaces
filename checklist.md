# Checklist

Some things worth thinking about at the start of your museum's next project:

- Are your signup forms respectful of people outside the gender binary?
- Do icons, photos, etc. assume things about gender or race of users?
- Is the project accessible for people with sensory impairments?
- Does the writing (especially in curatorial content) use language that visitors might find alienating/off-putting?
- What data are you collecting? Do you really need to be collecting it? Does the project respect the privacy of users (ex: online visitors in another country looking at content that might be considered restricted in their country of origin - gay rights, political content, etc).
- Whoâ€™s not here? Why?
