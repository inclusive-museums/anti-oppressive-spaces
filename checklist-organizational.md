# ENACTING INCLUSION
> Pathways Towards an Inclusive Museum

## A Cross-Contextual Approach:

Whether you are working in/with:
- Graduate Programs
- Association/Professional Network
- Small Museum
- Large Museum

The following sections should speak to functions and contexts that you are
familiar with in your day-to-day experience of a physical museum environment. 
The first section, "Shared Values," includes evaluation items that apply across every context 
mentioned above, while the following sections group items by functions that 
may apply to one or more of the contexts listed above. 
This is not to say that fulfilling each of these aspects of inclusion
will look/feel the same in every institution. Far from it. However, these items
can act as basic values from which to build an intentional, inclusive response
to a unique context.

## Shared Values:

- Inclusion integrated as core value rather than topic
  - Is inclusion work siloed in one position, department or issue addressed through
    one-off programming? Alternatively, how can inclusion be understood as both an
    institutional change process and a core value that each person within the
    institution commits to working on in their respective roles?
- Center Marginalized Voices / Decenter Whiteness
  - Does your institution/organization rely on narratives that take as their
    starting point the experiences of white (and/or straight, cis, male people who
    have no visible disabilities)? Set a priority to share stories of those with
    different perspectives as your starting point to counter this bias.
  - Do you recruit leadership that represents marginalized groups? Are they able to
    direct the overall development of your institution? Do you invite advisory
    leadership from marginalized communities in the telling of narratives focused on
    them or development of the storytelling media? If you plan to center narratives
    of marginalized groups/communities, how are you consulting with and listening to
    individuals from these groups?
- Community Asset Driven
  - Community Listening Focus
  - Communities grouped as status/identity specific not viewed as monolithic
  - Cocreation viewed as core method of content generation
  - How are you transparent in your interactions with communities and in how you represent yourself publically?
- Building Staff Analysis of Inclusion Vocabulary
  - What words do you use to describe or talk about inclusion in your institution?
    Where do they come from? Does everyone in your organization use the words the
    same way or understand them the same way? What new words/concepts are tools
    useful to your work? 

### SPATIAL/INTERPERSONAL/CURATORIAL
> Within Design (Architectural, Graphic), Exhibits, Collecting, Programs, Events (All Ages):

- Sensory Experiences
  - How do you honor different ways visitors sense or are able to sense content? 
  - How has your online content been made accessible? (See Anti-Oppressive Online Spaces Checklist)
  - Is your public space, program space and/or exhibit space scent-free? If not,
    consider a scent-free policy. This will also influence the selection of cleaning
    products. For artworks or interactives that have an olifactory element, make
    sure that visitors and staff are given the opportunity to consent/ opt into or
    out of that experience. Post signs in the space and on your website about 
    spaces that are or are not scent free.
   - Is your public space, program space and/or exhibit space low-sensory? If not,
    consider a low-sensory policy. This may tie in with institutional planning around
    serving visitors on the autism spectrum. Are there designated quiet spaces? 
    For artworks or interactive components with high or multi-sensory elements, 
    make sure staff and visitors are given the opportunity to consent/opt into or opt 
    out of the experience. Post signs in the space and on your website about high and low sensory spaces.

### PROFESSIONALIZATION

  communities- Provide/Participate inopportunities to skill and awareness build around Empathy, 
  Difference and Creating Safe Spaces (i.e. anti-racism, anti-oppression, social justice focus)
  - Sub-Group if applicable: White Privilege
    - Do you have a space for white people to work out their questions, concerns and
      build their understanding of concepts like white privilege together? A space
      such as this can insure support for white people in becoming allies, while
      making sure that large group, multi-racial conversation about inclusion can
      de-center white voices.
- Recruitment
  - Build Analysis of Applicant Selection Bias
  - Accessible Online Recruitment Information (See Anti-Oppressive Online Spaces Checklist)

      build their understanding of concepts like white privilege together? A space
      such as this can insure support for white people in becoming allies, while
      making sure that large group, multi-racial conversation about inclusion can
      de-center white voices.
- Volunteers/Interns

  especially if you are small instution. Make sure that your volunteer policy:
